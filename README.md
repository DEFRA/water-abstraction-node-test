This is a demonstration / test project to investigate using the [node test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) by the [water-abstraction-team](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-team).

## Why Node Test Runner?

We as a team would love to move the [water-abstraction-system](https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-system) project to use [ECMAScript Modules (ESM)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). The one thing that has held us back is testing. Projects in DEFRA currently use either [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Lab](https://hapi.dev/module/lab/) as their test frameworks (we use **Lab**). There are others, but they all share one thing in common; they don't support ESM natively. For example, ESM support in **Jest** is still marked as [experimental](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules). Typically, they rely on on transpiling your code back to CommonJS and then running tests against the transpiled code.

There's no 'right' way in development. But this feels a bit off to us. Hence our interest in **node test runner**. It is native to Node (no extra dependency), blazingly fast and one of few frameworks offering native ESM support without transpiling. If we switched to **node test runner**, we could claim our project as 100% ESM ü§ó

## Current status

At this time **node-test** is looking to be a viable alternative to **Jest** and **Lab**. After migrating a file from **water-abstraction-system** to ESM, the test file we create here is very similar to what we would have done in **Lab**.

All examples we've followed so far use the built-in [node:assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module. We didn't hit any blockers when first converting tests. But it doesn't have the expressiveness of [Hapi code](https://hapi.dev/module/code/), and it means every test needs updating.

So, we brought in [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/), which **Hapi code** is built from. It works fine with **node-test**, doesn't appear to impact performance, and means in a lot of cases we can do a simple copy & paste of the current test.

The output is similar to **Lab**, and we can see code coverage, though it is a little noisy (see comments below). We can also integrate the code coverage output with SonarCloud.

We've had to call our `test/` folder `specs/` because the ability to configure what is a 'test' is limited in Node v20*. For example, if the folder was called `test/` it would consider _every_ file in it a test. The same limitation applies to code coverage. The good news is these have been vastly improved in Node v22. So, if we were to upgrade before adopting **node-test** we could rename the folder and improve our code coverage reporting.

Another improvement is the use of `.only`. It is in Node v20*, but you have to add it at all levels for it to be applied. Again, Node v22* brings the feature more in line wih how we would use it in **Lab**.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- [Node.js v22.*](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL v14](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

First clone the repository and then drop into your new local repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-node-test.git && cd water-abstraction-node-test
```

Our preference is to run the database and API within Docker, so [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have it.

## Configuration

Any configuration is expected to be driven by environment variables when the service is run in production as per [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/config).

However when running locally in development mode or in test it makes use of the [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package. This is a shim that will load values stored in a `.env` file into the environment which the service will then pick up as though they were there all along.

Check out [.env.example](/.env.example) for details of the required things you'll need in your `.env` file.

Refer to the [config files](config) for details of all the configuration used.

## Initial build

The following will get an environment up and running quickly ready for development. It assumes 2 things

- you have Docker installed
- you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development

Open the project in VSCode and then use the [Command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) to access the tasks we have provided in [tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json)

With the palette open search for **Run test task** and once highlighted select it. From the list that's presented select **‚¨ÜÔ∏è UP (CMA)**

You should see a new terminal open up and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) begin to start building the images. Once that is done it will switch to running the app in docker.

The purpose of the project is to explore using node-test as our test framework, and how best to convert the service to ESM. So, the app does nothing and is not expected to be used.

## Running the tests

To run the unit tests call `npm test`. This is the default test script and will do the following.

- clean the test database of _all_ data then seed any reference data required, for example, regions.
- run the unit tests

The details for each test, a summary, plus code coverage will be output.

### Alternate test scripts

When working locally it is not always necessary to clean and seed the database before each run. For expedience, you can use `npm run test:skip` to get straight to running the test suite.

In CI we call `npm run test:lcov`. This switches the test reporter from the default [spec](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-reporters) to **lcov**, which generates a file test coverage tools can use.
