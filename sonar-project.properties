# Path is relative to the sonar-project.properties file.
# SonarCloud seems to have little intelligence when it comes to code coverage. Quite simply if it sees a code file, it
# checks it against our coverage report and if not found flags it as uncovered. This also effects the overall coverage
# score. In our case this means SonarCloud could flag everything under specs/ as lacking code coverage!
# We have found this combination of `sources`, `tests` and `tests.inclusions` means SonarCloud properly understands
# what is code and what is a test file.
